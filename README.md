Go To Last Workspace
====================

Extension for the Gnome Shell to quickly switch back to the previous
workspace you were using.

It installs a keybinding which defaults to <Super>escape. Repeatedly
pressing <Super>escape causes the active workspace to toggle between
the last two selected workspaces.

Only tested with Gnome version 3.20.
