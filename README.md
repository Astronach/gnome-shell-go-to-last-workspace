Go To Last Workspace
====================

Extension for the Gnome Shell to quickly toggle between the two last
workspaces with a single key (Super+Escape).

It installs a keybinding which defaults to <Super>escape. Repeatedly
pressing <Super>escape causes the active workspace to toggle between
the last two selected workspaces.

Only tested with Gnome version 3.20.
